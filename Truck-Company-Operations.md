# Truck and Transport Operations dashboard

## This is the operations report for a fictitious Truck and Transport company with KPIs and executive summary

I built this report based on fictitious data created in a Py-Spark notebook with the Fake Python library.

The report includes an executive summary with KPIs relevant to key stakeholders and the ability to drill-through to more detail.
